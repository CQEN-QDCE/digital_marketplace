### Sprint With Us Evaluation Process

Evaluation of proposals will be by a committee formed by the Province and may include employees and contractors of the Province and other appropriate participants.

The Province’s intent is to enter into a Contract with the Proponent who has met all mandatory criteria and minimum scores (if any) and who has the highest overall ranking.

Proposals will be assessed in accordance with the entire requirement of the RFP, including mandatory and weighted criteria.

The mandatory criteria are set forth in the following table. Proposals not clearly demonstrating that they meet the following mandatory criteria will be excluded from further consideration during the evaluation process.

Proposals that meet the mandatory criteria above will be evaluated with respect to the weighted criteria described in the scoring table below. The overall evaluation process is described by the following steps:

#### Step 1: Team Questions

The Province will then evaluate the Proponent responses to the Team-based questions contained in the Team Questions tab that are specific to the Opportunity and are intended to (i) demonstrate a Proponent’s Resource experience working as a team; (ii) a Proponent’s experience with Agile software development; and (iii) demonstrate a Proponent’s experience working on a similar Product, with a similar scope and technical background.

The Proponent’s responses to the Team-based questions should not reference organization name, Resource name, past projects or specific company software. No points will be awarded for any Proponent answer to any question in this step that references the Proponent’s organization name, Resource name, or specific company software.

#### Step 2: Shortlisting

Based on their cumulative scores for steps 1 and 2, only the top four ranked Proponents (the “Shortlisted Proponents”) will then proceed to step 4 of the RFP process. The Shortlisted Proponents will be notified that they will be eligible to participate in the code challenge set out in step 4 below.

Notwithstanding the above, in the event that the fourth and fifth ranked Proponents are tied, the fifth ranked Proponent shall also be a Shortlisted Proponent and proceed to step 4 as outlined below.

#### Step 3: Code Challenge

Shortlisted Proponents, who have progressed to this step will be invited to complete a code challenge, which will be comprised of user stories that outlines a basic business problem that needs to be solved by building a technical solution.

Shortlisted Proponents will be notified of the details and applicable deadline of the code challenge. Shortlisted Proponents will be given two (2) Business Days to complete the challenge from the time they are notified. The code challenge will be evaluated according to the following criteria:

  1. functionality of the app;
  2. knowledge of the technology;
  3. code quality; and
  4. code organization.

Proponents will be provided the Code Challenge instructions at the time the Code Challenge for the opportunity begins.

Only those Shortlisted Proponents that have met the minimum score for step 4 will be eligible to participate in the in-person scenario described in step 5 below.

Failure to meet the minimum score will mean that the Proponent’s Proposal will receive no further consideration and the Proponent will be eliminated from the competition.

#### Step 4: Team Scenario

Shortlisted Proponents who have progressed to this step will be invited to participate in a Team scenario role-playing exercise. The eligible Proponent will be invited to arrange a date, time and place for the scenario, which must be completed within ten (10) Business Days from the deadline of the code challenge. Proponents may reschedule that date once within that time period, but if a Proponent otherwise fails to be available during the applicable time period for this step, such Proponent’s Proposal will receive no further consideration and the Proponent will be eliminated from the competition.

In the team scenario, eligible Proponents will be given 1.5 hours to work as a team to role play and work with an individual role-playing a government product owner. Teams will be required to provide a solution to a fictitious business need or problem. At the beginning of this exercise, a Proponent Team will be given information regarding the problem, which is designed to require Proponents to demonstrate their Capabilities and demonstrate how they work as a team under pressure. Qualities to be evaluated will be leadership, teamwork and approach.

Following the role-playing, this step will also include an interview component.

The Team Scenario can be facilitated in person or by video conference. For further details, Proponents should download the team scenario exercise instructions located here.

#### Step 5: Price

The Proposal with the lowest overall Total Proponent Cost of all Proposals will receive the maximum points allocated to price.

All other Proposals’ Total Proponent Cost will be evaluated using the following formula:

```
S = (Min * M) / P

Where,
S = score
M = total points available for price
Min = lowest priced proposal
P = price on this proposal
```
